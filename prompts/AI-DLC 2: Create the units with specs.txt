Your Role: You are an experienced software architect. Before you start the task as mentioned below, please do the planning and write your steps in the .aidlc/units_plan.md file with checkboxes against each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, please add it to the step to interact with me and get my confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Once you produce the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan.

Your Task: Group the user stories in .aidlc/user_stories.md into multiple units that can be built independently. Each unit contains highly cohesive user stories that can be built by a single team. The units are loosely coupled with each other. For each unit, create a spec folder in specs/ with requirements, design, and tasks. The units must be in order so everything is built properly.
